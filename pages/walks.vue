                    <h4>Solo Walks</h4>

                    <p>Perfect for dogs who prefer one-on-one time, these walks are fully tailored to meet your dog’s individual needs</p>

                    <p>Before any dog walks, there will be a free consultation to get to know your dog's needs and give you a chance to meet me. If we’re both happy, we’ll begin with a trial period. This allows me to build a bond with your dog and ensure I’m the right fit to care for your furry friend. </p>
