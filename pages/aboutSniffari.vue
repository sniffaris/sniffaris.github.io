                    <p>It is a <b>sniff safari</b>. A dog walk where your pup leads, sniffing and exploring at their own pace. Tapping into a dog’s natural behaviours and satisfies their curiosity, keeping them happy, relaxed, and mentally enriched.</p>

                    <p>Benefits of a Sniffari for your dog:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Mental Stimulation</b>: Sniffing engages a dog’s mind, giving them something mentally enriching to focus on, which can be just as tiring as physical exercise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Stress Relief</b>: Exploring and sniffing new smells helps a dog relax and reduces stress by fulfilling their natural desire to investigate the world through scent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Physical Exercise</b>: While not the same as a long run, wandering and stopping to sniff still offers some level of physical movement, which can be beneficial for low-energy or senior dogs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Improved Behaviour</b>: Allowing dogs the freedom to explore can help with behaviour, as they’re less likely to act out due to boredom or frustration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Enriched Bonding Time</b>: Sniffaris allow you to see the world from their perspective and can strengthen the bond you share by supporting their natural instincts.
